 * Static routing strategy
 *
 * This routing strategy maps a path to a controller via a simple static array.  If the path matches an array key then
 * the controller name associated with that key is returned, otherwise the strategy returns null.
 *
 * This approach is limited to the paths you specify matches for, but is also potentially faster than more traditional
 * strategies.
